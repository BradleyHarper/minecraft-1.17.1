Q and A


#After running the start.bat script (either clicking on it or typing in "start start.bat" in the terminal). A message shows up stating that 'java' is not defined

- Download the Java JDK from here https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk17-windows


#Change the allocated ram?

- open start.bat and change the 'xmx' and 'xms' values. Examples (xmx1024m is 1GB of memory allocated to the server. You want 8 gigs? 8 * 1024 = 8,192. Replace the number value in the xms and xmx string accordingly.


#How do I update the server?

- inside the minecraft-1.17.1 folder type this into your terminal "git pull origin master in your terminal"


#One of my friends wants to host the server instead

- Add the new progress from the world by typing in "git add ." followed by git commit -m "new progress". Finally, "git push origin master"


#aint nobody gonna read this so just send me a message if you need help

-thanks
